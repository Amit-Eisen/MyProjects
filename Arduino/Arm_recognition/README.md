Hand Gesture 2DOF Robot

Overview: 
An Arduino-based 2 Degrees of Freedom robot controlled by hand gestures using an accelerometer.
The robot responds to pitch and roll angles, adjusting its base and arm movements accordingly.

Components:
 - Arduino board
 - 2 Servo motors
 - ADXL345 accelerometer

Libraries:
 - Servo
 - Wire
 - Adafruit_Sensor
 - Adafruit_ADXL345_U

Usage:
 - Upload code to Arduino.
 - Open Serial Monitor.
 - Tilt the accelerometer to control the robot.
 - Fine-tune PID for desired performance.
